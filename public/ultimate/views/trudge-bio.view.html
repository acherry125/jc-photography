				<p>Some say he is Indian, others place him as Mexican, most mention Africa, but I think he is a fruit-cereal killer. With astronomical planning for anti-jokes, he tactfully dismantles the fruitiness of his fellow teammates. The skills that he has adapted seem to stem from the spherical afro atop his head. Charles is a great lover of video games, disc golf, and classical music. Don't let his skinny frame, glasses, or nerdy demeanor fool you however. He is known to use his incredible afro powers to seduce a constant stream of female beings. This is not surprising however, as many people seem to succumb to the great afrodisiac. Charles has served gallantly as the Trudge Enforcer, demanding money from people and getting it every time. He developed those skills during extensive training sessions at the gay bar which led to his first round draft pick to Trudge. Many people had obtained ultimate powers at the time but Charles' afro put him clearly above the rest, ever in charge. Ironically he was required to chop it all off upon entering the RPI campus due to several doorways being too small for him. He is now only an image of what he once was, along with names like Afrodite, Afrostotle, Dafro Punk and DafroVinci. Occasionally he will grace us with the great powers when he grows it out, letting the golden age return once again.</p>

				<p>The Sklory begins sometime after the fall of the Soviet Union. Sklar's mischievous nature led him to become the sub-minister of the newly established Skloviet Union. Not long after, he acquired the name sub-optimus prime for his provocative nature in space missionary positions. In one particularly famous mission, Sklar was assigned to infiltrate the minds and bodies of the American youth. Sklar came out from behind the iron curtain and searched for Horace Mann high school, the epicenter of promiscuous "sex parties" that he was dying to attend. In order to attend these parties, Sklar became a pizza delivery man. Then using his untraceable cell phone from the late 1990's, he would order a pizza for the party and insist that the club manager in the back of the club ordered it. After misusing the powers of a pizza delivery man, Sklar's conscious told him the only way to right his wrongs was to order a pizza everyday even if he had no interest in eating more than one slice. If there is anything I've learned in my years of dealing with Sklar, it is that he is not to be underestimated. He spent almost four years perfecting his namesake move (known to this day as "Sklaring," a highly complex, sensual dance involving fingerbanging and vomit). /r/sklar is a highly informative source of info about the infamous guy.</p>

				<p>Contrary to popular belief, this new addition to Trudge is NOT two, identical, inseparable bros, it is but one confused young man. His susceptibility to confusion began when he was a baby, as his parents could never agree on what to call him, so they simply called him by two names: Gary and Ryan. By the time he reached high school, he had developed each name into their own unique personas, with a wide range of interests and abilities including slam poetry, synchronized swimming, speed reading, panty raiding, and what has been called “The most soulful Viola playing Longmeadow High School has ever seen.” The pair had quite a few similar interests as well, which led to them becoming best friends, or rather, for him to become best friends with himself.</p>
				<p>It is easy to understand the dilemma Trudge faced when the “duo” arrived on campus. He played as well as any two freshmen combined, handled and cut at the same time, and went on to defend two separate numbers, as per Trudge tradition. News spread quickly of GarRyan’s ultimate prowess, as the whole Metro East region buzzed about the phenomenon that was two players in one. Upon hearing rumor of this superhuman athletic performance, USA Ultimate altered the self-mack rule (XII.D.3), redubbing it the Mori-Shea rule, allowing for passes to oneself in extreme cases of schizophrenia. Trudge retains high hopes for the youthful duo, and anticipate many Eifs in their futures.</p>
